# Super Sync
*created for 2.00B Toy Product Design at MIT*

Super Sync is a 2v2 game where teams compete to send their superheros to the top of the Super Tower first. When the tower lights up with the color of the sync power, partners can help their superheros by matching the wristbands of the corresponding color against each other to harness it. This is called a Super Sync. 

The Super Tower is made up of acryllic, whereas the wristbands use magnetic reed switches, RFID scanners, and wireless modules to communicate with the Arduino within the Super Tower. 
This code powers the backend logic of the game Super Sync.
